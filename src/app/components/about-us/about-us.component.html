        <p>Are you looking for an off grid accommodation or a guest house? Maybe a student accommodation? Do you need a hunting lodge? You may need a work shed for your business. Or simply a substantial cottage during the holidays. We have the perfect solution for all your needs. We manufacture cabins on wheels from plank timber from a local sawmill. Floors and ceilings are insulated with environmentally friendly cellulose insulation made from recycled newsprint. We manufacture and sell our cottages in the basic version or partially or fully equipped with kitchen, bunk bed, toilet, hot water, electricity 220v and 12 volt system for off grid living. Our cottages are delivered with or without a trailer. The cottages are easy to pull by car. They have a unique system that makes it easy to lift and set off the cabin with accompanying jacks and be able to use the trailer for other activities. It is excellent to lift it all alone, it takes about 15min. We also take care of transport and help with setting up or moving the cottage if you choose to buy it without a trailer. No matter where your next adventure takes you, be sure to always bring your cabin. Your second home on the road.</p>
